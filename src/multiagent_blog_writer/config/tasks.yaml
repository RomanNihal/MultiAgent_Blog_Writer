blog_writing_task:
  description: >
    Using the detailed report as your source, write a 500-word blog post 
    about {topic}. Your mission is to make the "Future Forecast" section 
    of the report the star of the show. 
    - Use a creative, "click-worthy" title.
    - Start with a fun analogy (e.g., comparing {topic} to something 
      common like a garden, a kitchen, or a space voyage).
    - Keep sentences short and paragraphs under 3 lines.
    - End with a thought-provoking question for the reader.
  expected_output: >
    An engaging, 500-word blog post in Markdown. It must be simple enough 
    for a non-technical reader but informative enough to provide value.
